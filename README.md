Diabetes Prediction App

This repository contains a machine learning model and a web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. The model is trained using the Random Forest algorithm on a dataset of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Features:
- Interactive web interface for user input and prediction
- Random Forest classifier for accurate diabetes prediction
- Simple and intuitive user interface powered by Streamlit

Dataset:
The model is trained on the "diabetes.csv" dataset, which includes information such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Usage:
To use the Diabetes Prediction App, simply enter the required health-related details in the provided input fields and click the "Predict" button. The app will use the trained model to predict whether the person is diabetic or not.

Contributing:
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any ideas for improvement or would like to add new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
